## 1. INTRODUCTION AND CONTEXT (2 minutes)

### Opening (30 seconds)
"Good morning/afternoon, esteemed committee members. My name is Nuria Álvarez Río, and today I will present my Master's Thesis titled 'Digital Platform for Intelligent and Sustainable Distribution of Fresh Products through IoT and Modular Cloud-Based Architecture'."

### Problem Statement (1 minute)
"The food supply chain faces critical challenges that affect our society, economy, and environment:

- **Food waste**: The European Union estimates 88 million tons of food waste annually, with significant losses during transportation and distribution
- **Lack of transparency**: Consumers have insufficient information about product origin, production methods, and environmental impact
- **Inefficient logistics**: Traditional distribution networks cause suboptimal routing, higher costs, and significant carbon footprint
- **Limited traceability**: Current systems cannot track the complete journey of products, making quality incident management difficult

These problems create economic losses, environmental damage, and barriers for small producers to access markets."

### Solution Overview (30 seconds)
"Our solution is a comprehensive digital platform that integrates Internet of Things, blockchain technology, and cloud computing to create a transparent ecosystem connecting producers, retailers, and consumers while ensuring complete product traceability and sustainability."

1. **Backend System**: Built with FastAPI and PostgreSQL, providing RESTful APIs for all system operations
2. **Mobile Application**: Native Android app with role-based interfaces for consumers, producers, and retailers
3. **IoT Integration**: ESP32-based sensors monitoring temperature and humidity; GPS location comes from the consumer mobile app
4. **Blockchain Layer**: Ethereum-compatible smart contracts ensuring immutable product traceability"

### Technical Components (1 minute)
"**Backend Features:**
- Microservices architecture for scalability
- Real-time data processing
- Intelligent optimization algorithms for inventory management
- Multi-criteria sustainability evaluation

**IoT Sensors:**
- DHT11/DHT22 for environmental monitoring
- Data transmission to the backend via HTTP/REST
- GPS location provided by the consumer mobile application

**Blockchain Integration:**
- Smart contracts for product registration
- Immutable transaction records
- Complete supply chain traceability"

### System Flow (1 minute)
"The system operates through the following flow:
1. Producers register products with IoT sensor data
2. Blockchain records create immutable traceability
3. Consumers search for local products using the mobile app
4. Intelligent algorithms optimize distribution routes
5. Real-time monitoring ensures product quality throughout the supply chain"

## 3. PRACTICAL DEMONSTRATION (6 minutes)

### Demo Introduction (30 seconds)
"Now I will demonstrate the three main components of our system in action."

### Demo 1: Mobile Application (2 minutes)
"Let me show you the Android mobile application:

**Consumer Interface:**
- [Open app] Here we can see the main dashboard where consumers can search for fresh products
- [Navigate to search] Users can filter by product type, distance, and sustainability criteria
- [Select product] When selecting a product, we can see complete traceability information
- [Show traceability] This includes producer details, production date, environmental conditions, and transportation history

**Producer Interface:**
- [Switch to producer view] Producers can register new products, monitor their inventory, and track sales
- [Show product registration] The system automatically captures IoT sensor data during registration"

### Demo 2: IoT Sensors (2 minutes)
"Now let's examine the IoT sensor integration:

- [Show ESP32 device] This ESP32 device captures temperature and humidity
- [Open dashboard] The real-time dashboard shows current environmental conditions
- [Point to data] Temperature: 22°C, Humidity: 65% - within optimal ranges for fresh products
- [Show alerts] If conditions exceed thresholds, the system automatically generates alerts
- [Location] GPS comes from the consumer mobile application for proximity and routing features"

### Demo 3: Blockchain Traceability (2 minutes)
"Finally, let's explore the blockchain traceability system:

- [Open blockchain explorer] Here we can see the complete blockchain record for a specific product
- [Show transaction history] Each transaction represents a step in the supply chain
- [Highlight producer registration] This transaction shows the initial product registration by the producer
- [Show transportation] This transaction records the product's movement to a distribution center
- [Display final sale] This final transaction shows the product reaching the consumer
- [Verify authenticity] The blockchain ensures this information cannot be tampered with"
