## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Context and Motivation

The global food supply chain faces significant challenges in terms of efficiency, sustainability, and transparency. Traditional distribution systems often result in food waste, lack of traceability, and environmental impact due to inefficient logistics and long supply chains. The European Union estimates that approximately 88 million tonnes of food waste are generated annually, with a significant portion occurring in the distribution phase.

The increasing consumer demand for sustainable, locally-sourced products, combined with the need for complete product traceability, has created an opportunity for technological innovation in the food distribution sector. The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, cloud computing, and blockchain can provide solutions to these challenges by enabling real-time monitoring, intelligent optimization, and transparent supply chains.

This Master's Thesis presents the development of a comprehensive digital platform that addresses these challenges through an intelligent and sustainable distribution system for fresh products. The platform connects producers, retailers, and consumers in a transparent ecosystem that optimizes logistics, ensures product quality, and promotes sustainable consumption patterns.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

The current food distribution system presents several critical issues:

1. **Lack of Transparency**: Consumers have limited information about product origin, production methods, and environmental impact.

2. **Inefficient Logistics**: Traditional distribution networks often result in suboptimal routing, increased transportation costs, and higher environmental impact.

3. **Food Waste**: Poor inventory management and lack of real-time monitoring contribute to significant food waste throughout the supply chain.

4. **Limited Traceability**: Current systems provide insufficient tracking capabilities, making it difficult to identify and address quality issues or contamination events.

5. **Environmental Impact**: Long supply chains and inefficient transportation contribute to increased carbon emissions and environmental degradation.

6. **Market Access Barriers**: Small producers often face difficulties accessing broader markets due to complex distribution networks and high entry costs.
